export const lang1Text = `四月のある晴れた朝、原宿の裏通りで僕は100パーセントの女の子とすれ違う。

たいして綺麗な女の子ではない。素敵な服を着ているわけでもない。髪の後ろの方には寝ぐせがついたままだし、歳だっておそらくもう三十に近いはずだ。しかし五十メートルも先から僕にはちゃんとわかっていた。
  
彼女は僕にとっての100パーセントの女の子なのだ。彼女の姿を目にした瞬間から僕の胸は不規則に震え、口の中は 砂漠みたいにカラカラに乾いてしまう。あるいはあなたには好みの女の子のタイプがあるかもしれない 。例えば足首の細い女の子がいいだとか、やはり目の大きい女の子だなとか、絶対に指の綺麗な女の子だとか、よくわからないけれど ゆっくり時間をかけて食事をする女の子にひかれるとか、そんな感じだ。僕にだってもちろんそんな好みはある。レストランで食事をしながら、隣りのテーブルに座った女の子の鼻の形に見とれたりすることもある。しかし100パーセントの女の子をタイプファイすることなんて誰にもできない。彼女の鼻がどんな格好をしていたかなんて、僕には絶対に思い出せない。いや、鼻があったのかどうかさえうまく思い出せない。僕が今思い出せるのは、彼女はたいして美人じゃなかったということだけである。なんだか不思議なものだ。
  
「昨日100パーセントの女の子と道ですれ違ったんだ」と僕は誰かに言う。
 
「ふうん」と彼は答える。「美人だったのかい?」 
  
「いや、そんなわけじゃないんだ」
 
「じゃあ好みのタイプだったんだな」
  
「それが思い出せないんだ。目がどんな形をしていたかとか、胸が大きいか小さいかとか、まるで何も覚えていないんだよ」
  
「変なものだな」
  
「変なものだよ」
  
「それで」と彼は退屈そうに言った。「何かしたのかい、声をかけるとか、あとをついていくとかさ」
  
「何もしない」と僕は言った。「ただすれ違っただけさ」
  
彼女は東から西へ、僕は西から東に向けて歩いていた。とても気持の良い四月の朝だ。たとえ一二十分でもいいから彼女と話をしてみたいと僕は思う。彼女の身の上を聞いてみたいし、僕の身の上を打ちあけてもみたい。そして何よりも、一九八一年の四月のある晴れた朝に、我々が原宿の裏通りですれ違うに至った運命の経緯のようなものを解き明かしてみたいと思う。きっとそこには平和な時代の古い機械のよう な温かい秘密が充ちているに違いない。我々はそんな話をしてからどこかで昼食をとり、ウディー.アレンの映画でも観て、ホテルのバーに寄ってカクテルか何かを飲む。うまくいけば、そのあとで彼女と寝ることになるかもしれない。可能性が僕の心のドアを叩く。僕と彼女のあいだの距離はもう十五メートルばかりに近づいて いる。さて、僕はいったいどんな風に彼女に話しかければいいのだろう? 
  
「こんにちは。ほんの三十分でいいんだけれど僕と話をしてく れませんか?」 馬鹿げてる。まるで保険の勧誘みたいだ。
  
「すみません、このあたりに二十四時間営業のクリーニング屋はありますか?」これも馬鹿げてる。だいいち僕は洗濯物の袋さえ持ってはいないではないか。あるいは正直に切り出した方がいいのかもしれない。
  
「こんにちは。あなたは僕にとって100パーセントの女の子なんですよ」 彼女はおそらくそんな科白を信じてはくれないだろう。

それにもし信じてくれたとしても、彼女は僕と話なんかしたくないと思うかもしれない。あなたにとって私が100パーセントの女の子だとしても、私にとってあなたは100パーセントの男じゃないのよ、と彼女は 言うかもしれない。そういう事態に陥ったとしたら、きっと僕はおそろしく混乱してしまうに違いない。僕はもう三十二で、結局のところ年を取るというのはそういうことなのだ。
  
花屋の店先で、僕は彼女とすれ違う。温かい小さな空気の塊りが僕の肌に触れる。アスファルトの舗道には水が撒かれていて、あたりにはバラの花の匂いがする。僕は彼女に声をかけることもできない。彼女は白いセーターを着て、まだ切手の貼られていない白い角封筒を右手に持っている。彼女は誰かに手紙を書いたのだ。彼女はひどく眠そうな目をしていたから、あるいは一晩かけてそれを書き上げたのかもしれない。そしてその角封筒の中には彼女についての秘密の全てが収まっているのかもしれない。何歩か歩いてから振り返った時、彼女の姿は既に人混みの中に消えていた。
  
もちろん今では、その時彼女に向ってどんな風に話しかけるべきであったのか、僕にはちゃんとわかっている。しかし何にしても あまりに長い科白だから、きっと上手くはしゃべれなかったに違いない。このように、僕が思いつくことはいつも実用的ではないのだ 。とにかくその科白は「昔々」で始まり「悲しい話だと思いませんか」で終わる。
  
昔々、あるところに少年と少女がいた。少年は十八歳で、少女 は十六歳だった。たいしてハンサムな少年でもないし、たいして綺 麗な少女でもない。どこにでもいる孤独で平凡な少年と少女だ。で も彼らは。この世の中のどこかには100パーセント自分にぴったりの 少女と少年がいるに違いないと固く信じている。ある日二人は街角でばったりとめぐり会うことになる。
  
「驚いたな、僕はずっと君を捜していたんだよ。信じてくれないかもしれないけれど、君は僕にとって100パーセントの女の子なんだよ」と少年は少女に言う。少女は少年に言う。
  
「あなたこそ私にとって100パーセントの男の子なのよ。何から何まで私の想像していたとおり。まるで夢みたいだわ」 二人は公園のベンチに座り、いつまでも飽きることなく語りつづける。二人はもう孤独ではない。100パーセント相手を求め、100パーセント相手から求められるということは、なんて素晴らしいことなのだろう。しかし二人の心をわずかな、ほんのわずかな疑念が横切る。こんなに簡単に夢が実現してしまって良いのだろうか、と。会話がふと途切れた時、少年がこう言う。
  
「ねえ、もう一度だけ試してみよう。もし僕たち二人が本当に 100パーセントの恋人同士だったとしたら、いつか必ずどこかでまためぐり会えるに違いない。そしてこの次にめぐり会った時に、やはりお互いが100パーセントだったなら、そこですぐに結婚しよう。いいかい?」
  
「いいわ」と少女は言った。
  
そして二人は別れた。しかし本当のことを言えば、試してみる必要なんて何もなかったのだ。彼らは正真正銘の100パーセントの恋人同士だったのだから。そしておきまりの運命の波が二人を翻弄することになる。ある年の冬、二人はその年に流行った悪性のインフルエンザにかかり、何週間も生死の境をさまよった末に、昔の記憶をすっかり失くしてしまったのだ。彼らが目覚めた時、彼らの頭の中は少年時 代のD･H･ロレンスの貯金箱のように空っぽだった。しかし二人は賢明で我慢強い少年と少女であったから、努力に努力をかさね、再び新しい知識や感情を身につけ、立派に社会に復帰することができた。彼らはちゃんと地下鉄を乗り換えたり、郵便局で速達を出したりできるようにもなった。そして75パーセントの恋愛や、85パーセントの恋愛を経験したりもした。 そのように少年は三十二歳になり、少女は三十歳になった。時は驚くべき速度で過ぎ去っていった。そして四月のある晴れた朝、少年はモーニング･サービスのコーヒーを飲むために原宿の裏通りを西から東へと向い、少女は速達用の切手を買うために同じ通りを東から西へと向う。二人は通りのまんなかですれ違う。失われた記憶の微かな光が二人の心を一瞬照らし出す。彼女は僕にとっての100パーセントの女の子なんだ。彼は私にとっての100パーセントの男の子だわ。しかし彼らの記憶の光は余りにも弱く、彼らのことばは十四年前ほど澄んではいない。二人はことばもなくすれ違い、そのまま人混みの中へと消えてしまう。悲しい話だと思いませんか。

export const lang2Text = `One beautiful April morning, on a narrow side street in Tokyo’s fashionable Harujuku neighborhood, I walked past the 100% perfect girl.

Tell you the truth, she’s not that good-looking. She doesn’t stand out in any way. Her clothes are nothing special. The back of her hair is still bent out of shape from sleep. She isn’t young, either - must be near thirty, not even close to a “girl,” properly speaking. But still, I know from fifty yards away: She’s the 100% perfect girl for me. The moment I see her, there’s a rumbling in my chest, and my mouth is as dry as a desert.
  
Maybe you have your own particular favorite type of girl - one with slim ankles, say, or big eyes, or graceful fingers, or you’re drawn for no good reason to girls who take their time with every meal. I have my own preferences, of course. Sometimes in a restaurant I’ll catch myself staring at the girl at the next table to mine because I like the shape of her nose.
  
But no one can insist that his 100% perfect girl correspond to some preconceived type. Much as I like noses, I can’t recall the shape of hers - or even if she had one. All I can remember for sure is that she was no great beauty. It’s weird.
  
“Yesterday on the street I passed the 100% girl,” I tell someone.
  
“Yeah?” he says. “Good-looking?”

“Not really.”
  
“Your favorite type, then?”
  
“I don’t know. I can’t seem to remember anything about her - the shape of her eyes or the size of her breasts.”
  
“Strange.”
  
“Yeah. Strange.”
  
“So anyhow,” he says, already bored, “what did you do? Talk to her? Follow her?”
  
“Nah. Just passed her on the street.”
  
She’s walking east to west, and I west to east. It’s a really nice April morning.
  
Wish I could talk to her. Half an hour would be plenty: just ask her about herself, tell her about myself, and - what I’d really like to do - explain to her the complexities of fate that have led to our passing each other on a side street in Harajuku on a beautiful April morning in 1981. This was something sure to be crammed full of warm secrets, like an antique clock build when peace filled the world.
  
After talking, we’d have lunch somewhere, maybe see a Woody Allen movie, stop by a hotel bar for cocktails. With any kind of luck, we might end up in bed.
  
Potentiality knocks on the door of my heart.
  
Now the distance between us has narrowed to fifteen yards.
  
How can I approach her? What should I say?

“Good morning, miss. Do you think you could spare half an hour for a little conversation?”
  
Ridiculous. I’d sound like an insurance salesman.
  
“Pardon me, but would you happen to know if there is an all-night cleaners in the neighborhood?”
  
No, this is just as ridiculous. I’m not carrying any laundry, for one thing. Who’s going to buy a line like that?
  
Maybe the simple truth would do. “Good morning. You are the 100% perfect girl for me.”
  
No, she wouldn’t believe it. Or even if she did, she might not want to talk to me. Sorry, she could say, I might be the 100% perfect girl for you, but you’re not the 100% boy for me. It could happen. And if I found myself in that situation, I’d probably go to pieces. I’d never recover from the shock. I’m thirty-two, and that’s what growing older is all about.
  
We pass in front of a flower shop. A small, warm air mass touches my skin. The asphalt is damp, and I catch the scent of roses. I can’t bring myself to speak to her. She wears a white sweater, and in her right hand she holds a crisp white envelope lacking only a stamp. So: She’s written somebody a letter, maybe spent the whole night writing, to judge from the sleepy look in her eyes. The envelope could contain every secret she’s ever had.
  
I take a few more strides and turn: She’s lost in the crowd.
  
Now, of course, I know exactly what I should have said to her. It would have been a long speech, though, far too long for me to have delivered it properly. The ideas I come up with are never very practical.
  
Oh, well. It would have started “Once upon a time” and ended “A sad story, don’t you think?”
  
Once upon a time, there lived a boy and a girl. The boy was eighteen and the girl sixteen. He was not unusually handsome, and she was not especially beautiful. They were just an ordinary lonely boy and an ordinary lonely girl, like all the others. But they believed with their whole hearts that somewhere in the world there lived the 100% perfect boy and the 100% perfect girl for them. Yes, they believed in a miracle. And that miracle actually happened.
  
One day the two came upon each other on the corner of a street.
 
“This is amazing,” he said. “I’ve been looking for you all my life. You may not believe this, but you’re the 100% perfect girl for me.”

“And you,” she said to him, “are the 100% perfect boy for me, exactly as I’d pictured you in every detail. It’s like a dream.”
  
They sat on a park bench, held hands, and told each other their stories hour after hour. They were not lonely anymore. They had found and been found by their 100% perfect other. What a wonderful thing it is to find and be found by your 100% perfect other. It’s a miracle, a cosmic miracle.
  
As they sat and talked, however, a tiny, tiny sliver of doubt took root in their hearts: Was it really all right for one’s dreams to come true so easily?
  
And so, when there came a momentary lull in their conversation, the boy said to the girl, “Let’s test ourselves - just once. If we really are each other’s 100% perfect lovers, then sometime, somewhere, we will meet again without fail. And when that happens, and we know that we are the 100% perfect ones, we’ll marry then and there. What do you think?”
  
“Yes,” she said, “that is exactly what we should do.”
  
And so they parted, she to the east, and he to the west.
  
The test they had agreed upon, however, was utterly unnecessary. They should never have undertaken it, because they really and truly were each other’s 100% perfect lovers, and it was a miracle that they had ever met. But it was impossible for them to know this, young as they were. The cold, indifferent waves of fate proceeded to toss them unmercifully.
  
One winter, both the boy and the girl came down with the season’s terrible influenza, and after drifting for weeks between life and death they lost all memory of their earlier years. When they awoke, their heads were as empty as the young D. H. Lawrence’s piggy bank.
  
They were two bright, determined young people, however, and through their unremitting efforts they were able to acquire once again the knowledge and feeling that qualified them to return as full-fledged members of society. Heaven be praised, they became truly upstanding citizens who knew how to transfer from one subway line to another, who were fully capable of sending a special-delivery letter at the post office. Indeed, they even experienced love again, sometimes as much as 75% or even 85% love.
  
Time passed with shocking swiftness, and soon the boy was thirty-two, the girl thirty.
  
One beautiful April morning, in search of a cup of coffee to start the day, the boy was walking from west to east, while the girl, intending to send a special-delivery letter, was walking from east to west, but along the same narrow street in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo. They passed each other in the very center of the street. The faintest gleam of their lost memories glimmered for the briefest moment in their hearts. Each felt a rumbling in their chest. And they knew:
  
She is the 100% perfect girl for me.
  
He is the 100% perfect boy for me.
  
But the glow of their memories was far too weak, and their thoughts no longer had the clarity of fouteen years earlier. Without a word, they passed each other, disappearing into the crowd. Forever.
  
A sad story, don’t you think?
  
Yes, that’s it, that is what I should have said to her.

// {"englishParagraphs":["RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — Saudi Arabia and China signed a strategic partnership agreement on Thursday during a visit by the Chinese leader Xi Jinping to the kingdom, underlining the growing ties between Beijing and a longstanding American ally that is seeking greater self-reliance.","Mr. Xi held talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 37, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, in the first of a series of summits planned for the Chinese president’s three-day visit. After his bilateral meetings with Saudi officials, Mr. Xi is expected to attend twin summits with leaders from other Gulf, Arab and African countries, including Egypt, Djibouti and Iraq. The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, is also expected to join.","“This will be the largest and highest-level diplomatic event between China and the Arab world since the founding of the People’s Republic of China,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning, told reporters on Wednesday. “It will be an epoch-making milestone in the history of China-Arab relations.”","Saudi Arabia has long been a close ally of the United States, but its ties to China have been strengthening rapidly, turning what was once a mostly oil-based relationship into a more complex one involving arms sales, technology transfers and infrastructure projects. That shift predates the leadership of Prince Mohammed, who became heir to the throne in 2017: China eclipsed the United States as Saudi Arabia’s main trading partner years ago.","But Prince Mohammed has accelerated efforts to diversify Saudi Arabia’s alliances, trying to move beyond its reliance on the United States as its main security guarantor and weapons supplier to forge a more independent path.","Some of that is because of growing perceptions among officials, scholars and businesspeople in Saudi Arabia and the broader Middle East that the United States has lost interest in their region and is a superpower in long-term decline.","“I still think that the world is living within an American international security order,” though it is “stumbling quite frequently,” said Mohammed Alyahya, a Saudi fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard. “The worry is what will come in five years or 10 years.”","Saudi Arabia’s ties with the United States have been especially strained in the past few years, with President Biden pledging on the campaign trail to treat the kingdom like a “pariah” and pressing Prince Mohammed about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and Saudi citizen killed by Saudi agents in Istanbul in 2018.","Early in his administration, Mr. Biden released a U.S. intelligence report that said Prince Mohammed had most likely ordered the killing — a charge the crown prince denies. More recently, the two countries have clashed over a decision to cut oil production by the OPEC Plus cartel, which Saudi Arabia effectively leads.","The official Saudi Press Agency reported that King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Mr. Xi had met and signed a “comprehensive strategic partnership” agreement, without providing further details.","Under the agreement, the two sides agreed to hold meetings between their heads of state every two years, according to the Chinese news agency Xinhua. Beijing also agreed to list Saudi Arabia as a destination for group travel and to expand cultural and people-to-people exchanges, Mr. Xi said on Thursday during his talks with Prince Mohammed.","Other pacts signed by officials during the state visit included a memorandum of understanding on hydrogen energy and an “alignment plan” between China’s Belt and Road Initiative and Saudi Arabia’s economic diversification program, the Saudi Press Agency report said.","Upon arrival on Wednesday, Mr. Xi was met by a grander reception than Mr. Biden received in July, when the American president visited the coastal city of Jeddah, partly in a bid to repair ties with the Saudi government.","Footage of Mr. Xi’s reception on Wednesday showed jets flying overhead with smoke trails in the red and yellow colors of the Chinese flag.","On Thursday, he was taken to the palatial royal court, where his car, a luxury Chinese sedan, was escorted by horse riders carrying Saudi and Chinese flags. Prince Mohammed greeted him with a warm handshake, contrasting with Mr. Biden’s greeting of a fist bump.","The crown prince’s moves to deepen relationships with countries like China, Russia and South Korea are partly driven by his desire to establish Saudi Arabia a power in its own right, rather than an expectation that any of them could replace the United States. In that context, the pomp and circumstance around Mr. Xi’s visit is as much a signal to his domestic and regional audiences as it is to the United States. Many officials in the Gulf are preparing for what they believe is an emerging multipolar world, in which the United States no longer plays as central a role as it has since World War II.","“The American hegemony today over the international order won’t continue, in my estimation,” Anwar Gargash, a diplomatic adviser to the president of the neighboring United Arab Emirates, said at a public lecture earlier this year. “China has become a central economic player, a central technological player, a very important political actor.”","Prince Mohammed wants to diversify the oil-dependent kingdom’s economy, develop a civilian nuclear program and build a robust local defense industry. Securing technology and know-how from China is key to those goals, and Saudi pundits often compare the kingdom’s economic transformation to China’s decades ago.","ٍSaudi and Chinese companies signed 34 agreements on Wednesday in fields including information technology, genetics, mining, hydrogen energy and manufacturing. One Saudi firm partnered with a Chinese company to set up an electric vehicle plant in the kingdom.","Huawei, the telecommunications conglomerate targeted by American sanctions, signed a memorandum of understanding with a Saudi government ministry, partly to enable Huawei to build a data center in the kingdom.","At a conference in neighboring Bahrain last month, Brett McGurk, the top U.S. National Security Council official for Middle East policy, cautioned that “certain partnerships” with China will “create a ceiling” for what the U.S. is able to provide its allies.","“But thus far, we are not seeing that type of relationship that is getting in the way of what we are working here to build,” he said."],"chineseParagraphs":["沙特阿拉伯利雅德——周四，在中国国家主席习近平访问期间，沙特阿拉伯与中国签署了一项战略伙伴关系协议，突显北京与这一正在寻求更多自立地位的美国长期盟友之间日益密切的关系。","习近平与沙特实际统治者、37岁的王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼举行了会谈，这是他作为中国国家主席在为期三天的访问中计划出席的一系列峰会的第一场。在与沙特官员举行双边会晤后，习近平预计还将出席两场首脑会晤，会见包括埃及、吉布提和伊拉克在内的其他海湾国家、阿拉伯国家和非洲国家领导人。巴勒斯坦民族权力机构主席马哈茂德·阿巴斯预计也将出席。","“这是新中国成立以来中国面向阿拉伯世界规模最大、规格最高的外交行动，”中国外交部发言人毛宁周三对媒体表示。“将成为中阿关系发展史上具有划时代意义的里程碑。”","作为美国长久以来的亲密盟友，沙特阿拉伯与中国的关系正在迅速加强，原本主要以石油贸易为基础的两国关系变得更加复杂，涉及到军火销售、技术转让和基础设施建设。这种转变发生穆罕默德王子在2017年成为王储后掌权之前：中国多年前就超越了美国，成为沙特阿拉伯的主要贸易伙伴。","但穆罕默德王储加快了使沙特阿拉伯盟友多元化的努力，试图摆脱对美国作为其主要安全保障者兼军火供应国的依赖，开辟一条更加独立的道路。","究其原因，部分在于沙特阿拉伯乃至整个中东地区的官员、学者和商人愈发认为，美国失去了对该地区的兴趣，并且已经变成一个处于长期衰落阶段的超级大国。","“我仍然相信全球仍处于美国主导的国际安全秩序之下，”哈佛大学贝尔弗科学与国际事务研究中心的沙特问题研究员穆罕默德·阿勒亚亚说。“问题在于五年后或十年后会发生什么。”","沙特阿拉伯与美国的关系在过去几年尤为紧张，拜登总统在竞选期间承诺要将这一王国变成“贱民国家”，并就《华盛顿邮报》专栏作家、沙特公民贾迈勒·卡舒吉于2018年在伊斯坦布尔被沙特特工杀害一事向穆罕默德王储施压。","拜登政府上任之初就发布了一份美国情报报告，称很可能是穆罕默德王储下令谋杀卡舒吉，王储否认了这一指控。最近，两国又在“OPEC+”集团决定石油减产的问题上发生冲突，沙特阿拉伯正是该集团的实际领导者。","官媒沙特通讯社报道称，沙特阿拉伯国王萨勒曼与习近平会面并签署了“全面战略伙伴关系”协议，但未公布更多细节。","据中国新华社报道，双方在协议中同意，每两年轮流举行一次元首会晤。周四，习近平在与穆罕默德王储的会谈中表示，中方同意将沙特阿拉伯列为组团旅游目的地国，扩大双方人员往来和人文交流。","据沙特通讯社报道，在国事访问期间，官员们签署的其他协议包括一份关于氢能的谅解备忘录，以及中国“一带一路”倡议与沙特阿拉伯经济多样化计划之间的“对接计划”。","周三抵达后，习近平受到了比拜登更隆重的接待，今年7月，拜登前往沿海城市吉达，部分原因是希望修复与沙特政府的关系。","录像显示，周三，在习近平的接待仪式上，有喷气式飞机从头顶飞过，后面拖着中国国旗红黄两色的烟迹。","周四，他乘坐一辆中国产豪华轿车，由手持沙特和中国国旗的马队护送，前往富丽堂皇的皇宫。穆罕默德王储与他热情握手，这与拜登的碰拳致意形成鲜明对比。","沙特王储加深与中国、俄罗斯和韩国等国关系的举动在一定程度上是因为他希望让沙特成为一个独立的大国，而不是指望其中任何一个国家可以取代美国。在这种情况下，围绕习近平访问的种种排场既是向中国和本地受众发出的信号，也是向美国发出的信号。海湾地区的许多官员正在为他们心目中正在出现的多极世界做准备，在这个世界中，美国不再像“二战”以来那样发挥核心作用。","“在我看来，今天美国对国际秩序的霸权不会继续下去，”邻国阿联酋总统的外交顾问安瓦尔·加尔加什在今年早些时候的一次公开演讲中说。“中国已经成为核心的经济参与者，核心的技术参与者，非常重要的政治参与者。”","穆罕默德王储希望这个依赖石油的王国实现经济多样化，发展民用核项目，并在当地建立强大的国防工业。从中国获得技术和专业知识是实现这些目标的关键，沙特专家经常将沙特的经济转型与中国几十年前的经济转型进行比较。","沙特和中国企业周三签署了34项协议，涉及信息技术、基因、矿业、氢能和制造业等领域。一家沙特公司与一家中国公司合作，在沙特创办了一家电动汽车工厂。","被美国制裁的电信集团华为与沙特政府的一个部门签署了一份谅解备忘录，其中一个目的是让华为在沙特建立一个数据中心。","上个月在邻国巴林举行的一次会议上，美国国家安全委员会负责中东政策的高级官员布雷特·麦格克警告说，与中国的“某种伙伴关系”将给美国能够向盟友提供的东西“带来上限”。","“但是到目前为止，我们还没有看到有什么关系可能妨碍到我们在这里的努力，”他说。"]}

// {"englishParagraphs":["A day after China’s ruling Communist Party announced a broad rollback of the “zero Covid” restrictions that had smothered the economy and transformed life in the country, the propaganda apparatus on Thursday began the daunting task of promoting an audacious revision of history.","While the rest of the world concluded months ago that the coronavirus was becoming less deadly, Beijing presented the development as fresh news to explain its abrupt decision to undo the lockdowns that prompted widespread protests. In doing so, it also made a high-risk bet that vaccination rates in China are sufficient, or soon will be, to prevent a severe outbreak that overwhelms the nation’s hospitals.","“The pathogenicity of the Omicron strain of the coronavirus now is significantly reduced,” Wang Guiqiang, a health expert, told reporters in Beijing at a news briefing on Thursday that was widely covered in state media. “Everyone should treat it with a normal heart — there is no need to be nervous or even fearful.”","State television also trumpeted assertions that more than 90 percent of cases of the year-old Omicron variant are mild or asymptomatic, without explaining the sudden embrace of such conclusions. The health commission released details on how residents should quarantine at home if they test positive, instead of at hospitals. Workers began tearing down testing booths. Officials detailed new limits on when and how local authorities can impose lockdowns.","There were scenes of both relief and confusion over the easing of the lockdowns. Rush-hour traffic returned to Beijing’s long empty roads. People posted selfies marking their return to work and to dining at restaurants. But any celebratory mood seemed dampened by worries about getting sick, with people rushing to order home Covid test kits and fever medications.","Even China’s leader, Xi Jinping, seemed to distance himself from the unwinding of his signature policy, traveling to the Gulf for several regional summits — one of the few overseas trips he has taken during the pandemic. Mr. Xi’s travels were highlighted on the front page of the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece, where there was no mention of “zero Covid” or its overhaul.","For months, state media commentaries and experts had played up the threat of Omicron to justify his strict policy of lockdowns, mass quarantines and testing that had disrupted daily life.","“They knew the severity of Omicron, but they did not want to tell people the truth. Instead they started to exaggerate the severity of the disease, the virulence, in order to justify the policy of ‘zero Covid,’” said Yanzhong Huang, a global health specialist and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.","“Suddenly, you have all these experts coming out to justify why this policy relaxation is necessary,” he said, referring to health officials whose messages around the pandemic have pivoted drastically in recent days.","China’s jarring, whiplash-inducing narrative shift around Omicron points to the challenge for the party as it tries to prevent this week’s sudden abandoning of “zero Covid” from being construed as an admission of failure and a stain on Mr. Xi’s legacy. For years, China has pushed a triumphalist narrative about its top-down, heavy-handed approach to eradicating infections, saying that only the Communist Party, under Mr. Xi’s leadership, had the will and ability to save lives.","The changes the government announced on Wednesday — which would limit lockdowns and scrap mass mandatory quarantines and hospitalization for most cases — amounted to a reversal of “zero Covid” in the face of public opposition and mounting economic costs. But the party is deploying the full force of its propaganda and censorship apparatus to depict the transition as part of the plan all along.","More crucially, state media appeared to be distancing the policy shift from Mr. Xi, in stark contrast to the summer of 2020 when they had highlighted Mr. Xi’s declaration of victory against Covid when the restrictions curbed infections. Even the term “zero Covid” has suddenly disappeared from official statements and officials’ remarks.","Opening China up to a highly transmissible outbreak is not the success that Beijing had hoped to achieve, said Dali Yang, a professor at the University of Chicago. “They realized that this is not something that is worth celebrating,” he said. “Reopening has taken too long, and praising Xi may very well be counterproductive.”","Cases have surged, with the country reporting an average of around 30,000 cases a day in the last week, though with the cutting back of testing, such tallies are expected to soon result in an undercount. International experts have warned that China’s strategy of relying heavily on snap lockdowns and contact tracing, at the expense of ramping up vaccinations, has put the country at risk of overwhelming the chronically underfunded and understaffed public health care system. Compared with many other Asian countries, China has fewer intensive care beds per capita.","Images and videos posted on Chinese social media and state media showed the rapid dismantling of the some of the most widely feared or despised features of the “zero Covid” controls around the country. Workers carted away signs denoting mass testing sites and ripped down posters that restricted subway use to those who had negative Covid tests. Prefabricated makeshift hospitals, which Beijing had once touted as proof of its ability to mobilize but had quickly become symbols of the state’s power to detain citizens, were torn down.","Internet censors seemed to be trying to tread a delicate line. Xiao Qiang, an expert on censorship at the University of California, Berkeley, said that since the new policy was announced on Wednesday, censors have tried to erase posts and comments that either called for sticking to the stringent “zero Covid” measures or supported the complete removal of restrictions.","“The government has indeed turned 180 degrees, but it does not allow the public to call it a complete failure of the previous policy,” Mr. Xiao said. “It also wants to basically control the narrative that what the government did was right, and the new policy shift is not directly the result of the protests.”","For the party, the strategy of playing down the threat of the virus is a gamble because it can be difficult to predict how China will fare as the virus continues to spread unabated. But health officials are worried about a surge in cases overwhelming the country’s hospitals, especially after mandating for nearly three years that anyone who tests positive must be admitted.","In a speech reported by the China Youth Daily, a Communist Party newspaper, on Wednesday, a former infectious diseases official predicted that as much as 90 percent of the population could eventually be infected with Covid. Feng Zijian, the former deputy head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said officials must quickly accelerate vaccinations, especially in older people, and prepare the health care system for an influx of patients.","Spreading the message that most cases will not require any medical treatment could help hospitals with triage. On Thursday, China’s national health commission issued a plan that enabled Chinese to use store-bought rapid-antigen tests instead of relying on the widely criticized government-run P.C.R. tests. Residents who tested positive with self-administered tests could choose to quarantine at home, the plan said.","Many ordinary Chinese appeared to be bracing themselves for a widespread outbreak. On Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform, people shared tips for quarantining at home. Residents began to stockpile drugs and pain killers, including ibuprofen and acetaminophen, apparently driving up prices in stores.","At the same time, many Chinese were quick to point out the party’s abrupt turnabout in policy. On Weibo, users mocked experts who had been enlisted to justify the central leadership decisions. Foremost among them was Liang Wannian, the chief scientist working with the World Health Organization on studies into the origins of the pandemic. (For months, Mr. Liang talked up the deadliness of the Omicron variant, but told reporters on Wednesday that the virus “has now become milder.”)","“The people persisted in popularizing science to the experts,” wrote one widely circulating post on social media. “The experts finally realized that Covid is less serious than the flu.”","Hazel Liu, a resident in Beijing who had taken part in a recent protest, saw the easing as evidence that the public pressure campaign had worked. She was glad to see malls in the city lift rules requiring customers to show negative tests before entry. “I hope I can travel abroad in 2023!” she added.","In many ways, the new policy was also a vindication of health experts and others who had previously been silenced, or ignored, for questioning China’s zero-tolerance approach.","When Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, described China’s “zero Covid” policy as unsustainable in May, his comments were censored on the Chinese internet and denounced as “irresponsible” by a foreign ministry spokesman.","Chinese social media users shared articles recalling Zhang Wenhong, a epidemiologist in Shanghai and an earlier proponent of easing. Shortly after Shanghai entered a brutal 60-day lockdown in April, Mr. Zhang and other authors published a study on the weakening lethality of the Omicron variant that was widely criticized.","On Thursday, an article titled: “Mistaken criticisms of Zhang Wenhong and ‘living with the virus’ cost us a year,” was shared widely. The article was later removed.","Many Chinese returned to Dr. Li Wenliang, the first victim of censorship involving the pandemic, who died in early 2020 after contracting the coronavirus. Users flocked to Dr. Li’s Weibo page to leave heartfelt notes of solidarity. “Dr. Li, it’s finally over.” one user wrote. “We miss you. Thank you for your hard work.”"],"chineseParagraphs":["周四，在执政的中共宣布广泛取消扼杀经济、改变国民日常生活的“新冠清零”限制的第二天，中国的宣传机器开始了一项艰巨任务，那就是推动对历史的大胆修正。","虽然全世界其他地区在很久之前就已得出新冠病毒致死率正在下降的结论，但北京将这一事态发展当作全新信号，以此解释为何突然取消引发了广泛抗议的封锁措施。此举也意味当局下了一个高风险赌注，即中国的疫苗接种率能达到——或是很快能达到——防止导致全国医院不堪重负水平的严重暴发。","“目前新冠病毒奥密克戎毒株的致病力明显下降，”卫生专家王贵强周四在北京的新闻发布会上对记者表示，官方媒体对此进行了广泛报道。“大家还是以平常心对待它，不必要紧张甚至恐惧。”","国家电视台还大胆断言，对于已经传播一年之久的奥密克戎变异株，九成以上病例都是轻症或无症状感染者，却没有解释突然支持此类结论的理由。卫健委公开宣传居民在测出阳性后应如何在家隔离而不是去医院。工人开始拆除核酸检测点。官员们详细解释了地方政府何时以及如何实施封锁的新规定。","对于封锁的放松，民众在如释重负的同时也感到困惑。北京空旷已久的马路上，高峰时段又出现了车水马龙的景象。人们纷纷晒出复工和去餐馆吃饭的自拍照。但对生病的担忧似乎浇灭了庆祝的心情，民众纷纷抢购新冠快速检测试剂盒和退烧药。","就连中国领导人习近平似乎也与其标志性政策的松动保持了距离，前往海湾地区参加多场地区峰会，而这是他在疫情期间为数不多的海外访问活动。中共喉舌《人民日报》的头版重点报道了习近平的出访，对“新冠清零”及该政策的全面调整只字不提。","数月以来，官媒评论和专家声音一直在渲染奥密克戎的威胁，以证明习近平扰乱日常生活的严厉封锁、大规模隔离和检测政策的合理性。","“他们知道奥密克戎的严重程度，但不愿告诉民众真相。相反，他们开始夸大这种疾病的严重性和病毒的致病力，只为证明清零政策的合理性，”全球卫生问题专家、美国外交关系委员会高级研究员黄严忠表示。","“突然之间，所有这些专家又站出来说明为何放松这一政策是必要的，”他说道，指的是卫生官员最近在疫情相关信息上的急剧转向。","中国关于奥密克戎突如其来的急刹车式叙事转变，说明了中共所面临的挑战，即防止本周突然放弃“新冠清零”的举措被解读为认输，并给习近平的政治遗产留下污点。几年来，中国一直在宣扬采取自上而下的高压手段根除感染的必胜论，称只有习近平领导下的共产党才有意愿和能力拯救生命。","面对公众的反抗和不断加剧的经济代价，政府在周三宣布的调整——限制封控范围并基本取消大规模强制隔离和收治——相当于对“新冠清零”的逆转。但中共正在动用政治宣传和审查机器的全部力量，将这种转变描述为运筹帷幄的规划。","更为关键的在于，官媒似乎将政策转变与习近平拉开了距离，这与2020年夏天的情况形成鲜明对比，当时封控遏制了感染，官媒都在强调习近平宣布抗击新冠疫情的胜利。现在，连“新冠清零”的说法都突然从官方公告和官员发言中消失。","芝加哥大学教授杨大利表示，与高传染性的疫情短兵相接并非北京想要看到的成功。“他们明白这并不值得庆祝，”他说。“重新开放拖得太久，再赞美习近平可能适得其反。”","中国感染数已出现激增，上周平均每天报告约3万例。但随着检测减少，统计数字将很快出现降低。国际专家警告，中国严重依赖快速封锁和密接追踪，未能加快疫苗接种，可能导致长期资金和人力不足的公共医疗系统不堪重负。相较于亚洲许多国家，中国人均重症监护床位较少。","中国社交媒体和官方媒体上发布的图片和视频显示，全国各地“清零”管控措施中一些最令人恐惧或最让人厌恶的手段被迅速解除。工作人员运走了代表大规模检测点的标志物，撕毁了限制新冠检测阴性者乘坐地铁的海报。预制构件的方舱医院被拆除。北京曾将方舱吹捧为其动员能力的证明，但很快就成为了国家扣押公民权力的象征。","互联网审查机构似乎在小心翼翼地走钢丝。加州大学伯克利分校研究审查问题的专家萧强表示，自周三宣布新政策以来，审查人员一直试图删除那些呼吁坚持严格“清零”措施或支持完全取消限制的帖子和评论。","“实际上已经转向转了180度了，可是它不允许社会的舆论说这是前边的彻底失败，”萧强说。“它还要把它基本上控制在一个前边也是政府做的对，然后现在再出现的新的情况并不直接acknowledge（承认是）这个抗议（的结果）。”","对中共来说，淡化病毒威胁的策略是一场赌博，因为随着病毒继续有增无减，可能很难预测中国接下来的情况。但卫生官员担心病例的激增会让该国的医院不堪重负，特别是近三年来，所有检测阳性的人都必须入院。","在《中国青年报》周三报道的一篇讲话中，一名前疾控官员预测，多达90%的人口可能最终会感染新冠病毒。前中国疾病预防控制中心副主任冯子健说，官员们必须迅速加快疫苗接种，特别是老年人的疫苗接种，并使医疗系统为大量患者的涌入做好准备。","宣传“大多数病例不需要任何治疗”的信息，可以帮助减轻医院的负担。周四，中国国家卫生健康委员会发布了一份通知，允许中国人使用药店购买的快速抗原检测，而不是依赖由政府管理、广受批评的核酸检测。该计划称，自我检测呈阳性的居民可以选择居家隔离。","许多普通中国人似乎正在为大规模暴发做准备。在中国流行的社交媒体平台微博上，人们分享了在家隔离的种种技巧。居民们开始囤积药物和止痛药，包括布洛芬和对乙酰氨基酚，这似乎推高了药店的售价。","与此同时，许多中国人立刻指出了中共政策的突然转变。在微博上，用户嘲笑那些被请来为中央领导决策辩护的专家。其中最重要的是与世界卫生组织合作研究大流行起源的首席科学家梁万年。(几个月来，梁一直在鼓吹奥密克戎变种的致命性，但周三他对记者说，“目前的病毒更加温和了”。)","“老百姓坚持不懈地，对专家进行科普，”社交媒体上一个广泛流传的帖子写道。“专家终于明白，新冠比流感还轻。”","参加最近一次抗议活动的北京居民黑兹尔·刘（音）认为，这种放松是公众压力运动奏效的证据。她很高兴看到该市的商场取消了要求顾客在入场前出示核酸阴性检测结果的规定。“2023年我想出国旅游！”她还说。","在很多方面，新政策也证明了卫生专家和其他一些人的正确性，他们此前因质疑中国的“清零”态度而被迫保持沉默或遭到忽视。","今年5月，当世界卫生组织总干事谭德塞(Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus)称中国的“清零”政策不可持续时，他的言论在中国互联网上遭到审查，并被外交部发言人谴责为“不负责任”。","中国社交媒体用户分享了一些文章，回忆起上海流行病学家张文宏，他是放松政策的早期支持者。今年4月，在上海进入为期60天的残酷封锁后不久，张文宏和其他作者发表了一项关于奥密克戎变异株致命性减弱的研究，受到了广泛批评。","周四，一篇名为《错误批评张文宏和共存论，让我们失去了一年》的文章被广泛转发。这篇文章后来被删除。","许多中国人再次想到了李文亮，他是此次疫情审查的第一个受害者，并在感染新冠病毒后于2020年初去世。微博用户涌到李医生的主页，留下真诚的声援留言。“李医生，结束了。”一名用户写道。“想念您，谢谢你，辛苦了。”"]}
