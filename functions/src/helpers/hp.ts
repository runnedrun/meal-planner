THE BOY WHO LIVED 

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, 
were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, 
thank you very much. They were the last people you’d 
expect to be involved in anything strange or 
mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such 
nonsense. 

Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called 
Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy 
man with hardly any neck, although he did have a 
very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and 
blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of 
neck, which came in very useful as she spent so 
much of her time craning over garden fences, spying 
on the neighbors. The Dursley s had a small son 
called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer 
boy anywhere. 

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they 
also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that 
somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they 
could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. 
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t 




met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended 
she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her 
good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it 
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think 
what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in 
the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a 
small son, too, but they had never even seen him. 

This boy was another good reason for keeping the 
Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a 
child like that. 

When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray 
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the 
cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and 
mysterious things would soon be happening all over 
the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out 
his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley 
gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming 
Dudley into his high chair. 

None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past 
the window. 

At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his 
briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and 
tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because 
Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his 
cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley 
as he left the house. He got into his car and backed 
out of number four’s drive. 

It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the 
first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a 
map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he 
had seen — then he jerked his head around to look 
again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner 
of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What 
could he have been thinking of? It must have been a 
trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at 




the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around 
the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his 
mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet 
Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read 
maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake 
and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward 
town he thought of nothing except a large order of 
drills he was hoping to get that day. 

But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his 
mind by something else. As he sat in the usual 
morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that 
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people 
about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear 
people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups 
you saw on young people! He supposed this was some 
stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the 
steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these 
weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering 
excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see 
that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that 
man had to be older than he was, and wearing an 
emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it 
struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly 
stunt — these people were obviously collecting for 
something ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved 
on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the 
Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. 

Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in 
his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might 
have found it harder to concentrate on drills that 
morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in 
broad daylight, though people down in the street did; 
they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after 
owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an 
owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a 
perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five 
different people. He made several important telephone 




calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good 
mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch 
his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a 
bun from the bakery. 

He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he 
passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed 
them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but 
they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering 
excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting 
tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a 
large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words 
of what they were saying. 

“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ” 

“ — yes, their son, Harry — ” 

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He 
looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say 
something to them, but thought better of it. 

He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his 
office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, 
seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing 
his home number when he changed his mind. He put 
the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, 
thinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t 
such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots 
of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. 
Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew 
was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It 
might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no 
point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so 
upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame 
her — if he’d had a sister like that ... but all the 
same, those people in cloaks ...

第一  章  幸存的男孩 
住在四号普里怀特街的杜斯利先生及夫人，非常骄傲地宣称自己是十分正常的人。但 
是他们最不希望⻅到的就是任何奇怪或神秘故事中的人物，因为他们对此总是嗤之以鼻。 
杜斯利先生是一家叫作格朗宁斯的钻机工厂的老板。他非常肥壮、结实，几乎肥到没 
有颈根，但却有一把大胡子。杜斯利夫人则非常苗条，一头金发。她的颈根有常人的两倍 
那么⻓，这使得她整天伸⻓脖子透过花园围栏去偷窥邻居家的动静变得非常容易。杜斯利 
夫妇有个儿子叫做达德里。在他们眼中，这世界上再没有比达德里更棒的男孩了。 
杜斯利一家几乎有他们想要的一切东⻄。但是他们也有一个秘密，而且他们最大的担 
心就是有一天别人会发现这个秘密。如果有人知道关于波特一家的事，他们就会认为自己 
无法保守这个秘密了。波特夫人是杜斯利夫人的妹妹，但是她们已经有很多年没有⻅面 
了、事实上，杜斯利夫人假装她从来没有什么妹妹，因为她的妹妹和那不中用的妹夫没有 
一丝一毫杜斯利家族的⻛范。一想到波特一家的到来会招致邻居的议论，杜斯利一家就会 
浑身发抖。杜斯利一家知道波特夫妇也有一个儿子，只是未曾谋面。这个小男孩也成了杜 
斯利一家避开波特一家的借口，因为他们不希望听话的达德里与这种小孩混在一起。 
当杜斯利先生和夫人在灰暗阴沉的星期二早晨醒来时，我们的故事便开始了。 
虽然外面阴云密布的天空并不能预示着今天一定会有什么离奇古怪的事情发生。 
杜斯利先生一边哼着小曲一边拿出他最差的领带准备去上班，杜斯利夫人则一边口中 
叨念着一边把依依呀呀的达德里放到高椅子上去。 
没有一个人注意到这时有一只巨大的褐色的猫头鹰从窗外掠过。八点半时，杜斯利先 
生拿起他的公文包去上班。临行前，在杜斯刊夫人的面颊上吻了一下算是告别。他本来要 
在达德里脸上也亲一口的，但是因为达德里正在发脾气并且把⻨片往墙上扔，便只好作 
罢。  "  小淘气！  "  杜斯利先生呵呵大笑地走出⻔口钻进他的⻋，倒着⻋驶出了四号⻋道。 
当他驶到街的拐⻆处时，他发现了第一件不寻常的事情——一只猫在看地图。 
开始时杜斯利先生并没有感到有什么不妥。到他意识到并猛地转过头去看时，只⻅那 
只肥嘟嘟的猫还蹲在那里，可是地图却没有了。天哪，杜斯利先生想，我怎么可能有这种 
想法呢？ 
刚才我一定是眼花了。杜斯利先生眨了眨眼，又看了那只猫一眼。 
那只猫回了他一眼。正在杜斯利先生驶进拐⻆准备上另一条路时，他又在后视镜里看了 
一眼那只猫，现在那只猫正在读着  "  普里怀特街  "  的路牌——不，它只是朝路牌看而已，猫是 
不可能会认识任何地图或路牌的。杜斯利先生浑身一抖，想极力摆脱关于那只猫的任何想 
法。在接下来的路程里，杜斯利想的全都是关于他如何希望得到一大笔钻机的订单之类的事 
情。 

就快要到镇上的时候，关于钻机的想法又被其他事情代替了。 
像往常一样，杜斯利先生的⻋被卡在塞⻋⻓⻰中动弹不得，他不曾注意到好像有很多 
穿着奇怪的人走来走去。他们都穿着披⻛。杜斯列先生最看不惯穿得稀奇古怪的人——都 
是年轻人投酷的玩意！他想这也许是某种新的款式吧。他的手指不耐烦地敲击着方向盘， 
并目又看了看近处一群衣着古怪的人。他们在兴奋地小声谈论着什么，什斯利突然变得很 
生气，因为他发现他们并不都是年轻小伙子，其中一个穿着祖母绿披⻛的人居然比他年纪 
都大，搞什么⻤！ 
但接着杜斯利先生又不生气了，可能这是一出表演吧——这群人很明显在收集某样东 
⻄。是的，肯定是这样。⻋⻰开始移动起来，不久，杜斯利先生就到了格朗宁斯工厂停⻋ 
场。他的注意力又回到钻机上来了。 
杜斯利先生喜欢在他九楼的办公室里背靠着墙坐着。如果不这样做的话，他会觉得整 
个上午都无法集中精神做事。他从来没在大白天⻅过猫头鹰⻜过，但是有人在街上看到 
了。他们回头指着，目瞪口呆地看着一只接一只的猫头鹰从头顶⻜过。 
还好，杜斯利先生那天早上没⻅着一只猫头鹰，一切都很正常。他冲五个不同的人发 
了脾气。他打了几个重要的电话并在电话里嚷了一通。直到午饭时他的心情都还不错，那 
时他想到自己应该活动活动筋⻣了，于是走到面包店给自己买了一个面包圈。 
他几乎都快忘掉那些穿着被⻛的人了。但是当他走过面包店隔壁时，那群人又出现了。 
杜斯利先生生气地瞪了他们一眼。他不知道为什么自己要这样做，可能是那群人让他觉得不 
妥。那群人还在低声兴奋地谈话，可是这次杜斯利先生没再看到一只募款箱。在他拿着面包 
往回走又经过他们时，他依稀听到一些他们谈话的内容。 
"  波特一家，没错，我听到的就是这个名字。  " 
"  一定的，他们的儿子，哈利——  " 
杜斯利先生僵住了。害怕紧紧地攫住了他。他回过头看着那群人想跟他们说些什么， 
可是又不知道说什么好。 
他冲过⻢路，小跑回到办公室。嘱咐他的秘书不要打搅他，然后抓起电话就往家里打。 
打着打着，他突然改变主意了。他放下电话，抚弄了一下自己的胡子，陷入沉思。不，他太 
傻了。波特不过是个普通的名字。他肯定不只一个人叫波特并且他的儿子叫做哈利。想到这 
里，他甚至无法肯定他的侄儿是不是叫哈利。毕竟他从来没⻅过他。可能他叫哈维尔，又或 
者叫哈罗德，没有必要再去烦太太了，她一提到她妹妹就要叹气。这也不能怪她，如果杜斯 
利有个妹妹像她......不管怎么样，那些穿着被⻛的人...... 
他觉得整个下午都很难集中精力干活。当他五点钟离开办公室时，甚至担心自己一出 
⻔就会撞到什么人似的。 
"  对不起。  "  他咕哝着，面前站着一个踉踉跄跄的几乎要跌倒的矮老头。几秒钟后，杜斯 

利先生才发觉这个人穿着一件紫色的披⻛。他看上去对几乎被撞倒在地毫不介意。相反， 
他咧开嘴笑，并且用一种让旁人侧目的尖嗓子说话，  "  不要觉得抱歉，先生，今天没有任何 
事会惹恼我。只有开心！你知道最后谁离开了吗？像你这样的⻢格人都应该重视这个开心 
的日子！  " 
这个老人给了杜斯利先生一个只到腰间的拥抱，然后走开了。 
杜斯利先生定在了原地。他被一个陌生人拥抱，并且居然被叫作⻢格人，他被惹火了。 
他迅速地钻进⻋内往家赶，希望这一切不过是幻觉——而在这以前他是从来不相信有幻觉存 
在的。 
当地驰入四号驰⻋道时，映入眼帘的第一件东⻄——这丝毫没有让他心情好转——是 
他早上看到的那只猫。那只猫现在正在他的花园围墙上。他可以肯定是同一只猫，因为它 
们的眼睛周围有着一样的花纹。 
"  嘘！  "  杜斯利先生嚷道。 
那只猫没动。它又是冷冷地看了他一眼。这是一只猫的行为吗？杜斯利先生觉得很迷 
惑。为了试着让自己振作起来，他走进了房子。他仍然决定对妻子只字不提今天的事。 
杜斯利夫人则过得十分惬意、舒适。晚饭时她与丈夫谈起邻居与她儿子的不和以及达 
德里怎样学会了一个新单词  "  不许！  "  。杜斯利先生试图像平常一样答话。 
在把达德里哄上床后，他正好有时间看到晚间新闻的最后一条新闻：  "  各地的⻦类学家 
均报道全国各地猫头鹰有异常动向。通常猫头鹰在夜间捕⻝而且白天从不出现，但是这次 
却有许多地方⻅到这种⻦在日出后出现。专家们暂时难以解释猫头鹰突然间改变它们睡眠 
习惯的原因......真是非常奇怪。现在由吉姆。⻨高菲来报告天气。 
吉姆，今晚会有更多猫头鹰出现吗？  " 
"  泰德，  "  天气预报员说道，  "  这我倒不清楚。但是今天行为异常的不只是猫头鹰。还有 
肯特郡、约克郡和丹地的人们打电话告诉我并没有出现我昨天预报的阵雨，反而下了一场 
流星雨，可能人们在提前庆祝髯火节吧——但是髯火节下个星期才到啊！不管怎么样，今 
晚会有雨，我敢肯定。  " 
杜斯利先生呆在了沙发里。流星雨遍布英国？猫头鹰在白天行动？身穿披⻛的神秘人 
处处可⻅？还有传闻，关于波特一家的传闻...... 
杜斯利夫人端着两杯咖啡走进卧室。不行，他必须告诉她一些事情。他清了清嗓子，  " 
嗯，帕尤妮亚，你很久没有收到你妹妹的来信了，是吧？  " 
已如他预料的，杜斯利夫人看上去又震惊又生气。毕竟，她通常会当自己从来没有妹 
妹。 
"  没有。  "  她生硬地说：  "  怎么了？  " 

"  今天的新闻多可笑，  "  杜斯利先生含糊地说，  "  猫头鹰......流星雨......还有许多⻓相滑 
稽的人在镇上......  " 
"  那又怎样？  "  杜斯利夫人打断了他的话。 
"  我只是觉得......可能......这与她的......家庭有关。  " 
杜斯利夫人呷了一口茶，杜斯利先生不知道自己是否还敢告诉她他听到了  "  波特  "  这个 
名字。他尽量使自己好像是很随意地说出：  "  他们的儿子——应该差不多有达德里这么大了 
， 是吧？  " 
"  我想是吧。  "  杜斯利夫人生硬地 
说。  "  他叫什么名字？是豪伍吗？  " 
"  哈利。如果你问起，我要说这是个难听又普通的名字。  " 
"  哦，是吗？  "  杜斯利先生说，他的心猛地一沉。  "  没错，我赞成。  " 
他们上楼去睡觉时杜斯利先生再没有就这件事讲一个字。当杜斯利夫人洗澡时，他蹑 
手蹑脚地走到卧室窗口往下面的花园看。那只猫居然还在！它望看街拐⻆处，好像在等 
谁。 
他又在想象了？所有的事会不会都跟波特家有关呢？如果是这样的话......如果他们真 
的有联系——他简直不敢往下想。 
杜斯利夫妇上了床。杜斯利夫人很快便睡着了，但是杜斯利先生却睡不着，翻来覆去 
地想着。在他入睡前最后一个稍微安慰的想法是：即便整件事与波特家有关，也并不意味 
着一定会牵扯到他和他太太。波特家非常清楚他和帕尤妮亚是怎样看待他们的......他觉得 
他和帕尤妮亚不可能与将来可能发生的事有任何关联。他打了一个呵欠并翻了一个身。不 
让波特影响到他们的......他真是大错特错。 
杜斯利先生可能已经忐忑不安地进入了梦乡，可是外面那只在墙上的猫却毫无睡意。 
它一动不动地坐在那里，眼睛一下也不眨地盯着普里怀特街的拐⻆处。即使有汽⻋⻋⻔砰 
地一声关上，两只猫头鹰从头顶⻜过，它也不动一下。实际上，直到将近午夜它都没动。 
这时一个男人出现在猫一直盯住的拐⻆处，他出现如此突然又无声无息，以至你会认 
为他是从地下冒出来的，那只猫动了一下尾巴，眯起了双眼。 
这个人从未在普里怀特街出现过。他又高又瘦，从他那银白色的头发以及⻓到可以塞进 
皮带的胡子，可以看出他已经很老了。他穿着⻓袍，一件拖到地的紫色披⻛以及一双高跟、 
带扣的靴于。他耶双半月形眼镜底下的蓝色眼睛炯炯有神。他的鼻子又⻓又弯，好像被至少 
扁过两次。这个男人的名字是艾伯斯。丹伯多。
